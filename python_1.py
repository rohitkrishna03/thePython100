#  typecasting in python
# conversion of one data type in to another is called type .casefold
a ='1';
b='2';
# print(a+b);

# the above code prints 12 because we have put the integers in quotations which becomes string
# if we want to print the number swhich are in string format we can print by 
print(int(a) + int(b));
# a =1;
# b=2;
# print(a+b);
# this gives the output 3 because its an integer
# there are two type of conversions explicit conversion and implicit conversion

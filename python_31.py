# IF...ELSE IN ONE LINE
# there is also a shorthand syntax for if-else statement that can be used when the condition
# being tested in simple and the code blocks to be executed are shorts.


# below is the example for short hand if...else

a = 12345
b =1234
print("A") if a>b else print("=") if a==b else print("B")
c = 9 if a>b else 0
print(c)


# here we write the short hand statements ifn single line without expressing brief.
# writing the short hand statements keeps our code maintainable.

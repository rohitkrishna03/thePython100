# in python you put anything under double quotes it comes under string
# and we can make the string with double and single quote
# a string is usually a sequence or array of textual data
# for example: a =('rohit')
# here rohit is a string
name = 'rohit'
sname='krishna'
content= 'his name is rohit "and krishna also'
print('hello  '+  content)
print('hello ' + name)

# multi line string litrals
apple ='''he said, hi rohit
i am good
"i want to eat apple"'''
print(apple)

# now lets print the index of characters
print(apple[5])
# here it sprints the second index that oresent in the apple content
print ('characters in apple')
for characters in apple:
    print(characters)
